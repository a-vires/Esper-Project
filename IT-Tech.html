Dan is a Sr. Software Engineer at Fat Zebra.He has over 15 years’ experience in PHP/ Java Development (Backend) and has been in the industry for almost 20 years.

                                                <br>
                                                A. Dan works in an agile team environment, and only reports to the PM (Project manager) and sometimes Directors when he doesn’t like his PM, Its very rare that he will report to other analyst and clients as he tends to avoid confrontation, and prefers to be left alone to code. When other developers ask him for assistance, he sends them the API Documentation rather than pair programming with them, since his is a bit introverted. </p>
